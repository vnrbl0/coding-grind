    <h1>CSS Specificity & Cascade </h1>
    <p>CSS specificity is a set of rules that determines which CSS rule applies when multiple rules could apply to the same element. It is calculated based on the types of selectors used in the rule.</p>
    <p>Here's a quick overview of how specificity is calculated:</p>        
    <ul>
        <li>Inline styles (e.g., style="color: red;") have the highest specificity.</li>
        <li>ID selectors (e.g., #myId) have a higher specificity than class selectors.</li>
        <li>Class selectors (e.g., .myClass), attribute selectors (e.g., [type="text"]), and pseudo-classes (e.g., :hover) have a lower specificity than ID selectors.</li>
        <li>Type selectors (e.g., div, p) and pseudo-elements (e.g., ::before) have the lowest specificity.</li>
        <li>Universal selector (*) has no specificity.</li>
        <li>Inserting important in a rule (e.g., color: red !important) will override any other rules, regardless of specificity.</li></li>
    </ul>
    <p>When multiple rules apply to the same element, the rule with the highest specificity will be applied. If two rules have the same specificity, the one that appears last in the CSS will take precedence.</p>
    <p>Understanding specificity is crucial for writing effective CSS and avoiding conflicts between styles.</p>

    <p>Remember, specificity is all about understanding how CSS rules are applied and ensuring that your styles are predictable and maintainable.</p>
